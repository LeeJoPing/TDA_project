TDA signal processing implications on human voice classification

Our project delves into the fundamental question of how topological features of human voices relate to the original signal and how these features can help classify different human voices. To elaborate on the definition of voice used in this report, voice includes different words spoken by the same speaker as well as the same word spoken by different speakers. This exploration, along with the implementation of machine learning, has the potential to greatly enhance existing speaker recognition techniques and other signal processing methods. That is to say, by incorporating our findings on the relationships between voice signals and their persistent homology diagram with current deep learning models, current audio processing techniques can significantly improve in their accuracy and efficiency. Overall, our project lays the groundwork for future research on how TDA can enhance current technologies in the fields of speech recognition and signal processing.
