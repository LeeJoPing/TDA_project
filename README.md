Hello World!

TDA signal processing implications on human voice classification:

This project investigates how topological features of human voices correlate with the original signal and how these features can aid in classifying different human voices. We define "voice" to encompass variations in speech by the same speaker and across different speakers. Through machine learning implementation, our research holds promise for significantly enhancing speaker recognition techniques and other signal processing methods. By integrating our findings on voice signal relationships with persistent homology diagrams into current deep learning models, we anticipate improvements in accuracy and efficiency of audio processing techniques. This work lays the foundation for future exploration of how Topological Data Analysis (TDA) can augment existing technologies in speech recognition and signal processing.

The "Signal Processing" notebook analyzes sample speech recordings, converting human voices into vectors through signal embeddings. It then illustrates the process of obtaining persistent diagrams for these signals and converting them into heatmaps, which serve as representations for subsequent classification tasks.

In the "Classification Model" notebook, we showcase the use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to visualize speech embeddings in a 3D space. Our findings demonstrate the potential of leveraging topological properties as features for signal-related tasks, suggesting the feasibility of employing TDA with machine learning models for classification tasks.
